1. I have used **Dataframe_cleanup_NPTEL.ipynb** file to clean, organise and rectify the dataset **apy.csv**.
2. **apy_filtered.csv** is the filtered dataset with null values removed, name of the crops rectified, I have also removed some crop like Apple, Pear etc. from the dataset because they do not contain any detailed information.
3. You can find both the datasets (filtered and original) in **Datasets** folder.
