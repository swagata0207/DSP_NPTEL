# About the project
I have done this project during my industrial training (which was necessary in B.Tech curricullam). The dataset I got from the institute I was training in, was quite simple one because there was only two columns in the given dataframe and the whole dataframe converted into time series data at the time of reading the csv file.
> Plotted various graphs using matplotlib.pyplot & seaborn library.

> Implemented Linear Regression using Scikit-learn library to predict the outcome for a certain input.

*Note: I did some changes in the project after completion of the training to make some improvements and for practice purposes.
